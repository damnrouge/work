TLS Handshake (Step-by-Step Flow):

1. Client Hello:
   - The client initiates the handshake by sending a "hello" message to the server.
   - The message includes:
     - Supported TLS versions.
     - Cipher suites (encryption algorithms) it can work with.
     - A random string called the "client random."

2. Server Hello:
   - In response to the client hello, the server selects the best TLS version and cipher suite.
   - The server sends:
     - Its SSL certificate (including the public key).
     - Another random string called the "server random."

3. Server Certificate:
   - The server's certificate is sent to the client for authentication.
   - The client verifies the certificate's authenticity.

4. Client Key Exchange:
   - The client generates a "pre-master key" for symmetric encryption.
   - The pre-master key is encrypted with the server's public key and sent back to the server.

5. Change Cipher Spec:
   - Both sides use their private keys to decrypt the pre-master key.
   - They generate a shared secret (session key) for further communication.

6. Finished:
   - Both parties send an encrypted "finished" message to confirm successful key exchange.
   - All data exchanged between client and server is now encrypted using the shared session key.
