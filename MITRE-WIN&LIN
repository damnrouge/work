Windows MITRE ATT&CK Framework:

#Tactic: Initial Access
Definition: Techniques that enable adversaries to gain entry into a network.
- Techniques & Examples:
  - Drive-by Compromise: User visits a malicious site that exploits a browser vulnerability.
  - Phishing: Deceptive emails trick users into revealing credentials.
  - Valid Accounts: Stolen credentials are used to access systems.
  - Exploit Public-Facing Application: Vulnerabilities in web applications are targeted.
  - Supply Chain Compromise: Third-party software updates are manipulated.

#Tactic: Execution
Definition: Techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a system.
- Techniques & Examples:
  - Command and Scripting Interpreter: PowerShell scripts execute commands.
  - User Execution: Users are tricked into running malicious code.
  - Scheduled Task: Tasks are scheduled to execute malware.
  - Service Execution: Malicious services are run on the system.
  - Exploitation for Client Execution: Client software vulnerabilities are exploited.

#Tactic: Persistence
Definition: Techniques adversaries use to maintain their foothold.
- Techniques & Examples:
  - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Malware runs at system startup.
  - Create Account: New accounts are created for access.
  - Modify Existing Service: Services are altered to run malware.
  - Scheduled Task: Malware is scheduled to run periodically.
  - Server Software Component: Server components are modified for persistence.

#Tactic: Privilege Escalation
Definition: Techniques used to gain higher-level permissions.
- Techniques & Examples:
  - Exploitation for Privilege Escalation: System vulnerabilities are exploited.
  - Valid Accounts: Legitimate credentials are used for higher access.
  - Access Token Manipulation: Tokens are manipulated to elevate privileges.
  - Create or Modify System Process: System processes are altered or created.
  - Bypass User Account Control: UAC is bypassed to elevate privileges.

#Tactic: Defense Evasion
Definition: Techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection.
- Techniques & Examples:
  - Obfuscated Files or Information: Artifacts are hidden.
  - Deception: Decoys mislead defenders.
  - Modify Registry: Registry values are changed to disable security features.
  - Rootkit: Rootkits conceal the presence of malware.
  - Impair Defenses: Security tools are disabled.

#Tactic: Credential Access
Definition: Techniques used to steal credentials.
- Techniques & Examples:
  - Credential Dumping: Credentials are extracted from the system.
  - Input Capture: Keystrokes are logged to capture credentials.
  - Steal Web Session Cookie: Cookies are stolen to hijack sessions.
  - Brute Force: Automated guessing of passwords.
  - Man-in-the-Middle: Network traffic is intercepted to capture credentials.

#Tactic: Discovery
Definition: Techniques used to gain knowledge about the system.
- Techniques & Examples:
  - System Owner/User Discovery: Identifying users or system owners.
  - System Information Discovery: Gathering system information.
  - Network Service Scanning: Scanning for network services.
  - Remote System Discovery: Identifying remote systems.
  - Permission Groups Discovery: Finding permission group memberships.

#Tactic: Lateral Movement
Definition: Techniques used to move through a network.
- Techniques & Examples:
  - Pass the Hash: Stolen hash values are used to authenticate.
  - Remote Services: Services like RDP are used to move laterally.
  - Replication Through Removable Media: Malware spreads via USB drives.
  - Taint Shared Content: Shared content is compromised to move laterally.
  - Use of Network Logon Scripts: Scripts are used to move to other systems.

#Tactic: Collection
Definition: Techniques used to gather data of interest.
- Techniques & Examples:
  - Data from Local System: Data is collected from local system sources.
  - Data from Network Shared Drive: Data is collected from network drives.
  - Data from Removable Media: Data is collected from USBs and other media.
  - Email Collection: Emails are gathered from the target.
  - Screen Capture: Screenshots are taken to collect information.

#Tactic: Command and Control
Definition: Techniques that establish communication with compromised systems.
- Techniques & Examples:
  - Commonly Used Port: Standard ports are used for C2 traffic.
  - Communication Through Removable Media: USB drives are used for C2.
  - Multilayer Encryption: Multiple layers of encryption protect C2 traffic.
  - Web Service: Web services like Twitter are used for C2.
  - Uncommonly Used Port: Non-standard ports are used for C2 traffic.

#Tactic: Exfiltration
Definition: Techniques used to steal data.
- Techniques & Examples:
  - Data Encrypted: Data is encrypted before exfiltration.
  - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol: Protocols like DNS are used for exfiltration.
  - Exfiltration Over Command and Control Channel: C2 channels are used to exfiltrate data.
  - Automated Exfiltration: Data is automatically exfiltrated.
  - Exfiltration Over Physical Medium: Data is moved out via physical means.

#Tactic: Impact
Definition: Techniques used to disrupt, destroy, or manipulate systems.
- Techniques & Examples:
  - Data Destruction: Data is deleted or otherwise destroyed.
  - Data Encrypted for Impact: Data is encrypted to deny access (ransomware).
  - Defacement: Websites are defaced.
  - Disk Wipe: Disks are wiped to destroy data.
  - Service Stop: Services are stopped to disrupt operations.
