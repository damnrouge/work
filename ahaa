  ### Response Guidelines for AWS Excessive Security Scanning Alert

#### 1. **Initial Alert Review**
   - **Alert Details:**
     - Confirm the alert details: user identity, event count, timestamps, targeted AWS services, user agents, request parameters, and recipient account.
     - Verify if the number of Describe, List, or Get API calls exceeds 50 and assess the context of the activity.

#### 2. **User Activity Investigation**
   - **User Verification:**
     - Verify the legitimacy of the user account and its credentials.
     - Check for any previous similar activities by the user.
   - **Behavior Analysis:**
     - Analyze the user’s activity logs to identify any unusual or unexpected behavior.
     - Compare the user's current activity with their historical behavior patterns.

#### 3. **API Call Analysis**
   - **Identify API Calls:**
     - Determine the specific Describe, List, or Get API calls made by the user.
     - Assess whether these API calls are typical for the user's role or access level.
   - **User Agent Analysis:**
     - Identify the user agents involved in the API calls (e.g., Scout Suite, Paku).
     - Determine if these user agents are associated with known reconnaissance tools.
   - **Request Parameters and Recipient Account:**
     - Analyze the request parameters to understand the scope and specifics of the API calls.
     - Identify the recipient account(s) involved in these API calls.

#### 4. **Immediate Containment**
   - **Account Actions:**
     - Temporarily suspend the user account if the activity is confirmed to be suspicious.
     - Revoke or reduce the user’s permissions to critical resources.
   - **Network Actions:**
     - Isolate any systems or instances that might be compromised.
     - Implement temporary network segmentation if needed.

#### 5. **Detailed Investigation**
   - **Log Analysis:**
     - Conduct a detailed review of AWS CloudTrail logs for additional context and evidence.
     - Look for signs of data access or exfiltration attempts.
   - **Reconnaissance Indicators:**
     - Investigate other indicators of reconnaissance, such as unusual login times, access from multiple IP addresses, or access to new resources.
   - **System Integrity Check:**
     - Verify the integrity of the AWS environment and ensure no unauthorized changes have been made.
     - Check for any signs of data exfiltration or access to sensitive data.

#### 6. **Communication and Coordination**
   - **Stakeholder Notification:**
     - Inform relevant stakeholders, including the user's manager and security team members, about the suspicious activity.
     - Coordinate with other security teams for a unified response.
   - **Incident Documentation:**
     - Document all findings, actions taken, and conclusions in an incident report.
     - Include evidence from logs, user activity, and any other relevant data.

#### 7. **Post-Incident Review and Actions**
   - **User Education:**
     - If the activity was non-malicious but inappropriate, provide guidance on proper usage.
   - **Policy and Rule Adjustment:**
     - Review and update security policies and detection rules to prevent similar incidents.
   - **Awareness Training:**
     - Conduct training sessions to raise awareness about security practices and potential threats.
   - **Enhanced Monitoring:**
     - Place the user under enhanced monitoring for a defined period.
     - Regularly review logs and alerts for any signs of repeated suspicious activity.

#### 8. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - **Enhanced Monitoring:**
     - Continue to monitor the user and related activities closely for a defined period.
     - Adjust monitoring rules and thresholds based on insights gained from the incident.

By following these response guidelines, you can ensure a comprehensive and effective approach to handling excessive security scanning alerts in AWS, mitigating potential risks, and maintaining the security and integrity of your cloud infrastructure.
