  The objective of this alert is to detect excessive security scanning activities in AWS by identifying a high volume of Describe, List, or Get API calls from a single user. By leveraging AWS CloudTrail logs, we count distinct event names and flag any user with more than 50 such events. This behavior is significant as it may indicate reconnaissance activities by an attacker trying to map out our AWS environment. If these activities are confirmed to be malicious, they could potentially lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further exploitation of our cloud infrastructure.
