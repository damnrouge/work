 Based on my observations, Sita Ram is a good analyst but occasionally gets confused when making decisions. He tends to be hesitant about reaching out to people. When we interacted, he asked me for resources to learn and sometimes pinged me about understanding previously resolved alerts. We discussed URL/malware analysis, and he learned quickly and applied the knowledge effectively. He consistently supports and helps colleagues during shifts, never hesitating to pick up alerts.

I believe he would benefit from more training on the topic and a bit more guidance. He needs some time to settle in, and I should participate more to help him express his queries and understand the topic better.
