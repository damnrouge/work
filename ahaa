From the screenshot provided, it appears you're looking to create response guidelines for a specific alert related to public network access in a cloud environment (likely Azure). Hereâ€™s a clear, actionable guide for how to respond to this type of alert:

Response Guidelines for Public Network Access Alert

1. Initial Triage and Validation

Verify if Public Network Access was Required:

Check if the access was intended or needed for a specific use case.

Identify if it aligns with internal security policies and compliance standards.


Cross-reference with Change Management:

Ensure any public access settings were pre-approved via change management processes.

If no documentation is found, escalate for further investigation.



2. Investigate the Alert:

Source of Alert:

Identify the resource (e.g., Storage Account, Key Vault, App Configuration) that triggered the alert.

Validate the user or service that enabled public network access.


Assess Time and Frequency:

Determine when the public network access was enabled (firstTime and lastTime).

Review any activity performed after public access was enabled.



3. Review Azure Resource Access Control:

Permissions Review:

Ensure that the proper RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is applied, minimizing access to only authorized personnel.


Network Security Groups (NSG) and Firewalls:

Verify if additional network security controls (e.g., NSGs, firewalls) are properly configured to restrict access even when public network access is enabled.



4. Take Immediate Action if Needed:

Disable Public Access:

If unauthorized or non-essential public access is found, immediately disable it.

Use cloud-native tools to restrict access (e.g., Private Endpoints, Virtual Networks).


Isolate the Affected Resource:

In case of suspected malicious access, isolate the resource until further investigation is complete.



5. Notify Relevant Teams:

Incident Response Team:

Alert the SOC/Incident Response team to handle the incident as part of the response process.


Data Owners and Admins:

Notify the owners of the resource for further remediation or validation.



6. Documentation and Reporting:

Annotations (CIS 20, MITRE ATT&CK, NIST):

Correlate the findings with relevant security frameworks. For example:

CIS 20 Control: Control 12.9, Ensure all network devices have logging enabled.

MITRE ATT&CK: T1578, Modifying Cloud Compute Infrastructure.

NIST: Refers to Access Control (AC-1) under NIST 800-53.



Kill Chain Stage:

Determine where this event fits in the kill chain model (e.g., exploitation, persistence).



7. Post-Incident Actions:

Audit Logs and Forensics:

Gather logs from Azure activity and security monitoring to analyze any potential exploitation or lateral movement.


Review Security Policies:

Ensure policies are updated to avoid public network access where not necessary.


Provide Detailed Reports:

Ensure that a full incident report is generated, including the timeline, actions taken, and preventive measures.



By following these guidelines, you ensure a structured and effective response to public network access alerts, aligning with security best practices and compliance requirements.
